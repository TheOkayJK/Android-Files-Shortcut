# Help and Support
Unfortunately due to different OEMs adding custom file managers not every device is compatible.

The file manager this app links to is also only available on devices running Android version 7.0 \(Nougat\) and up.

This is due to the fact that older versions of Android only have a simple downloads folder app by default.

If you want a **free** and **open source** file manager app Simple File Manager Pro is my go to option.

Simple File Manager is available for free on **[Github](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-File-Manager)**,
**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.filemanager.pro/)**,

and can be purchased, to support development, from the **[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.filemanager.pro)**.
