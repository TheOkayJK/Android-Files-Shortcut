## What User Data I Collect

The only data that is collected is done by Google, and that data is **not** in any way personally identifiable. It consists of basic installation statistics including, but not limited to number of installations, installations by country, and uninstallations. There is no way (that I personally am aware of) to disable this so if you have any complaints you can take it up with Google.
